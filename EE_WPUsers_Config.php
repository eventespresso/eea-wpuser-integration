     * When true (default):
     * - If the logged in user has never had a relationship set between the user and the contact record, the
     * relationship will be created on the initial registration between the contact for the primary registration and
     * this user.
     * - On subsequent registrations by this user, the contact record from previous registrations for that user will be
     * used for the primary registration and ANY changes to that contact record will sync both with the contact record
     * AND related wp user details for that account.
     *
     * When false:
     * - If the logged in user has never had a relationship set between the user and the contact record, the
     * relationship will be created on the initial registration between the contact for the primary registration and
     * this user.
     * - On subsequent registrations by this user, if the contact details for the primary registrant are changed
     * (personal question group), then a NEW contact record is created and there is NO relationship setup between this
     * user and this new contact. The existing contact relationship is preserved.
     *
     * The main difference between the two options is in the former (true) - EVERY registration by a logged in user is
     * attached to the same contact for the primary registration, and the user has a record of every event they've
     * registered for.
     * Whereas with the second option (false) - a record of events the user has registered for ONLY applies when the
     * personal questions for the primary registration have not been changed.
